Notes

** This is to show how to separate subsets of photos
** that share the same styling

This would go in html:
<!-- 	<div class="photo" id="cat"></div>
	<div class="photo" id="dog"></div>
 -->

 This would go in css:
 /* This is to show how to style a title
.photo h3 {
	font-size: 2em;
	font-family: calabri;
	color: #005500;
	margin: 0 center;
}

#dog {
	color: #550000;
}

#cat {
	color: #ffff00;
}*/
